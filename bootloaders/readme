The bootloader for all the AEM daughter boards is identical, and a modified version of Optiboot for Atmega2560. To burn it, you'll need a suitable AVR or JTAG programmer.
The software tool to burn the bootloader is avrdude. Install it with
$ sudo apt-get install avrdude

Then run the following command (assuming you have a JTAG ICE mk II connected, for other programmers see avrdude documentation using command $ man avrdude):
$ avrdude -c jtag2isp -p atmega2560 -P usb -vv -Uflash:w:stk500boot_v2_mega2560.hex -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U hfuse:w:0xD8:m -U efuse:w:0xFD:m -U lock:w:0xFF:m 

It is important to set the correct fuses, otherwise the bootloader won't be accessible!
